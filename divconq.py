    def encode_message(self, msg:str) -> str:
        """
        A function that encodes a given string using a simplified form of caesar cipher (without using modulo). Every character of the string will be 
        transformed into the ordinal/numerical representation and encoded by shifting the number with self.caesar_shift 
        (through addition). Afterward, the shifted numbers are transformed into bitstring representation.

        For example, suppose we want to encode the message 'hello' with a caesar shift of 5. 
        The corresponding encoded message (output of this function) would be '1101101 1101010 1110001 1110001 1110100'. Note that the 
        number of bitstrings separated by spaces is equal to the number of characters of the string 'hello'. 
        Let's look at the first character 'h'. Its ordinal representation is 104. We shift its representation by 5, giving us 109. 
        109 is then transformed into a bitstring, which gives us 1101101 (the first bitstring in the encoded message). 

        Hints: the following built-in Python functions may be of use
          - ord(x): takes a character x as input and returns the ordinal representation
          - '{0:b}'.format(x): transforms a number x into a bitstring

        """
        The divide and conquer search function. The function searches for value in a subset of self.loc_grid.
        More specifically, we only search in the x-region from x_from up to (and including) x_from and the y-region
        from y_from up to (and including) y_to. At the initial function call, x_from=0, x_to=self.width-1, y_from=0, y_to=self.height-1 ,
        meaning that we search over the entire 2d grid self.loc. 
        This function recursively calls itself on smaller subproblems (subsets/subrectangles of the 2d grid) and combines the solutions
        to these subproblems in order to find the solution to the complete initial problem.

        Note: this function should be more efficient than a naive search that iterates over every cell until the value is found. 
        Thus, make sure design a proper divide and conquer strategy for this. A too simplistic strategy (search over every cell in the grid) 
        will not lead to a passing grade. Please consult the TAs before handing in the assignment whether your approach is good.
